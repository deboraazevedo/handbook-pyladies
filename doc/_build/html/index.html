<h2>So You’ve Decided to Start Your Own PyLadies Chapter<a class="headerlink" href="#so-youve-decided-to-start-your-own-pyladies-chapter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>YAY! We’re excited to have people like you join our growing community
and want to help you get your chapter launched as quickly and painlessly
as possible. If our experience is any indication, your first major event
will galvanize and inspire the Python community in your area and create
momentum for subsequent events, so it’s crucial to start things off on
the right foot!</p>
<p>To help you get started, we’ve created an open-source kit for starting
your own PyLadies chapter in your city. PyLadies is part social club,
part stepping stone toward the Python open-source world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-you-need">
<h2>What you need<a class="headerlink" href="#what-you-need" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You may of course adapt this list to meet your chapter’s needs.</p>

<h3>Organizers<a class="headerlink" href="#organizers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<h3>Promotion and Outreach<a class="headerlink" href="#promotion-and-outreach" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Various local channels for promoting your group, including meetup.com,
local PUGs, related groups, and universities. Also, a list of global
PyLadies channels that you can use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="events">
<h3>Events<a class="headerlink" href="#events" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At minimum, try to hold one event a month &#8211; this helps keep interest in
PyLadies from flagging, and helps people maintain their progress in
becoming better developers. You can hold more events with proper support
and planning.</p>
</div>

<h2>About PyLadies Chapters<a class="headerlink" href="#about-pyladies-chapters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="types-of-chapters">
<h3>Types of Chapters<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-chapters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A chapter can be:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>a geographic chapter: for a city, region, state, or country</li>
<li>a student chapter: for a university, college, or school</li>
<li>an interest group chapter: for any topic (e.g. PyGame, SciPy, Django)</li>
</ol>
<p>The larger the chapter, the harder it is to meet in person. Large
chapters’ events will be mostly virtual meetups that occur online,
whereas small chapters’ events tend to be in-person meetups.</p>
<p>A chapter can consist of sub-chapters, making both the in-person and
virtual meetups possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-size">
<h3>Chapter Size<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It’s fine if your chapter is small. Having just 2-3 women who meet
regularly to exchange Python tips and tricks counts as a chapter. What matters
most is quality, not quantity.</p>
<p>Larger chapters have more flexibility to organize different types of
events, but it’s harder to get everyone together for dinner.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initial-setup-of-your-chapter">
<h3>Initial setup of your chapter<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-setup-of-your-chapter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Email <a class="reference external" href="mailto:info&#37;&#52;&#48;pyladies&#46;com">info<span>&#64;</span>pyladies<span>&#46;</span>com</a> with the following info:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Names/emails of co-organizers.</li>
<li>Desired subdomain for your chapter
(<a class="reference external" href="http://your-subdomain.pyladies.com">http://your-subdomain.pyladies.com</a>). This can be geographic,
university/school-related, interest group-related, or almost any
other name of your choice.</li>
<li>1-2 paragraph blurb about your chapter so we can announce it on
<a class="reference external" href="http://pyladies.com/blog">pyladies.com/blog</a> and in the PyLadies
global newsletter.</li>
<li>Desired email address (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:whatever&#37;&#52;&#48;pyladies&#46;com">whatever<span>&#64;</span>pyladies<span>&#46;</span>com</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Create at least one of the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>a group on Meetup.com for your chapter (recommended; ask us about
sponsorship if you need help with the Meetup subscription fees)</li>
<li>a website and mailing list for your chapter (note: Meetup.com has
this built in; consider using that to simplify things)</li>
</ol>
<p>Post a description of your first event on your Meetup.com group or
website. It can be as simple as “We’re getting together at X Coffee
Shop, 123 Main St., Anytown to make plans for our new PyLadies chapter.
All local Python developer women (and their +1 guests) (and men
interested in helping out) are invited.”</p>

how to promote your first chapter event!</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org">learnpythonthehardway.org</a> and
instructed to work through the tutorial, asking for help as needed. They are
urged to post exercises to Github, as a way to dip their toes in the world

for details.</p>
<p>The IRC #pyladies channel is always available for anyone to use for
virtual meetups. Feel free to use it without asking, or create a
#pyladies-whatever channel if you prefer.</p>

<div class="section" id="meetups-as-part-of-a-python-user-group-pug-meetup">
<h3>Meetups as part of a Python user group (PUG) meetup<a class="headerlink" href="#meetups-as-part-of-a-python-user-group-pug-meetup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A PyLadies event can be as simple as women getting together and talking
about each others’ Python projects in a small group after a local PUG
event.</p>
<p>Anything to encourage women to attend and continue attending PUGs is
great. Talk to your local PUG organizers and ask for their help and
support in having a post-PUG informal PyLadies meetup.</p>
<p>You might also consider trying to give a &lt;doc&gt; at a
meetup. This can help bring more beginners who might otherwise be
scared away to the group.</p>

<p>Python conferences that might interest your chapter: PyCon, DjangoCon,
PloneConf, SciPy (Python for Scientific Computing)</p>
<p>What you can do to prepare together:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Brainstorm talk ideas. Help each other put together talk outlines.</li>
<li>Review each others’ talk proposals.</li>
<li>Practice talks in front of each other, in a small group.</li>
<li>Practice in a larger group, as a joint event with the local Python
user group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conferences can be stressful, but they’re also a lot of fun,
particularly if you’re attending with a friend or a small group. There&#8217;s
also a good chance you will run into PyLadies from other chapters!</p>

<div class="section" id="promotion">
<h2>Promotion<a class="headerlink" href="#promotion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One benefit of creating a PyLadies chapter is having access to a

your events.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-promote-your-events-locally">
<h3>How to promote your events locally<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-promote-your-events-locally" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Post an event description on your <a class="reference external" href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a>
page or website.</li>
<li>Announce the event via your mailing list.</li>
<li>Create event flyers and distribute them at meetups, Python user group
meetings, work, and the local universities. See [upload example or
template to git repo] for an example.</li>
<li>Approach the career offices and engineering/science departments of
local colleges and universities.</li>
<li>Contact old professors and teachers. Tell them about what you’re
doing; they’ll be glad to hear from you. Ask to make an announcement
to their current students at the start of their classes, or as an
email.</li>
<li>Attend local tech/Python meetups. Be an active part of the local
developer community. Show that you care about getting more women into
Python development and programming in general. Be humble and ask for
help from the group.</li>

<div class="section" id="how-we-can-help">
<h3>How we can help<a class="headerlink" href="#how-we-can-help" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Email the main point of contact for any of the following channels, and
provide text and/or images for us to use:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Global PyLadies Newsletter: Good for announcements about meetups.
Subscribers from all over the world. Please keep the text
brief and include an image. (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:info&#37;&#52;&#48;pyladies&#46;com">info<span>&#64;</span>pyladies<span>&#46;</span>com</a>)</li>

7. #pyladies IRC channel (FreeNode)</p>

<h3>Guidelines for using the PyLadies promotion channels<a class="headerlink" href="#guidelines-for-using-the-pyladies-promotion-channels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Anything of interest to women in the Python community can be posted in
the various PyLadies channels, provided that it meets these guidelines:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Send us the actual text that you want posted.</strong></li>
<li>For local PyLadies chapter events:<ul>
<li>Send text for as many events as possible to the channels listed above.
The more we can promote your events, the better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For non-chapter events and general postings:<ul>
<li>Postings should be relevant to women.  Mention the women organizing
and/or attending the event.  Have their names link to their websites or
Twitter accounts.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t just reuse the same blurb that you use everywhere; customize it to
be relevant to the specific audience you&#8217;re addressing.</li>
<li>We&#8217;d love to use the various channels to feature what PyLadies from
everywhere are doing.  If you know of someone who should be featured,
you can write up something interesting for the blog, Twitter stream, etc.</li>
<li>If you are hosting a Python community event or conference and need our
help getting more women to attend, submit proposals, etc., a heartfelt
explanation about why more women should attend and feel welcome goes a
long way. A PyLadies discount code also helps: keep in mind that a huge
part of our audience are students/those just starting out professionally
with Python, who cannot afford to commit to events or submit
proposals unless there is a known, guaranteed PyLadies discount.</li>

<div class="section" id="finding-sponsors-raising-funds">
<h2>Finding Sponsors/Raising Funds<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-sponsors-raising-funds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If your chapter is small, you don’t necessarily need sponsors. Hosting
chapter meetups at coffee shops, restaurants, or people’s houses is
fine.</p>
<p>However, you may want to organize trips, conferences, and other types of
more costly events. If so, you will need to raise local chapter funds
and ask local Python shops to consider sponsoring an event.</p>
<div class="section" id="venue-sponsors">
<h3>Venue Sponsors<a class="headerlink" href="#venue-sponsors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Research local companies and approach them. Often, a company that
already hosts other meetups will be willing to host your PyLadies
chapter. Ask them if they’ll provide pizza/drinks; if not, charge
attendees a fee that covers food (and more, if you want to use the funds
for future events).</p>

<h2>Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#policies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We try not to have too many rules and regulations (everything above
has been nothing more than advice we offer to make things easier for
you, given that we learned much of it the hard way). Generally, chapter
organizers are free to do whatever they want, as long as it’s in the
best interest of their local chapter and/or PyLadies in general.</p>
<p>The following policies have been written up so that you may simply copy
and paste them into email responses, to help you deal with awkward or
tricky situations.</p>
<div class="section" id="official-pyladies-guest-policy">
<h3>Official PyLadies Guest Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#official-pyladies-guest-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>(If anyone asks to stay with you in the future other than a trusted
friend, say something like &#8220;I wish we could accommodate you, but
PyLadies has a strict policy of not allowing members to host out-of-town
guests&#8221; and then paste this, minus the parenthetical note.)</p>
<p>In the interest of safety and security of our members, PyLadies
organizers, volunteers, and members are not permitted to host overnight
out-of-town guests who wish to visit town for PyLadies events.</p>

<h3>Policy on Controversial Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#policy-on-controversial-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a PyLadies local chapter organizer, you may be asked for PyLadies’
position on controversial issues. Often, these are diversity-related
issues.</p>
<p>PyLadies’ policy is to have no official position on controversial
issues. By choosing this policy, we allow ourselves to be a group full
of diverse ideas and differing viewpoints.</p>

<h3>Can men attend local PyLadies chapter events?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-men-attend-local-pyladies-chapter-events" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It’s up to you. Generally, it’s good to hold women-only events as well
as events for both genders (either women and +1 guests, or anyone who
wants to attend). Just be aware that the dynamic of the room tends to
change when the male:female ratio becomes lopsided.</p>
<p>A good way to hold a mixed-gender event is to partner with a local
Python user group.</p>
<p>Be extra-clear in your event description about whether men are
allowed/what the rules are &#8211; it will save you a lot of time, and
prevent awkward conversations.</p>

<h3>Is there anything like PyLadies specifically for men?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-there-anything-like-pyladies-specifically-for-men" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There doesn’t seem to be a burning need for a PyLadies for Men ;) That
said, if you’re a man and want to start a similar group, we’ll support
you. You can even make PyLadies knock-off t-shirts. One enterprising
gent has printed “PyLaddies” shirts, and there is an IRC channel on
Freenode, #pygents, for the men who love PyLadies =)</p>

<h3>Can I use the PyLadies logo and graphics for any purpose?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-use-the-pyladies-logo-and-graphics-for-any-purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Any of the graphics at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies-kit">https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies-kit</a>
can be used for your own chapter promotion. Feel free to use them for
websites, printed materials, t-shirts, and anything else that benefits
your chapter.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have an official chapter, you can use the graphics for
anything women-in-Python related, as long as any funds resulting from
your use of the graphics go toward Python gender diversity initiatives.</p>

<div class="section" id="can-transgender-women-be-pyladies">
<h3>Can transgender women be PyLadies?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-transgender-women-be-pyladies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Anyone who considers herself a lady and does Python is a PyLady/Python
lady. We support all women, whether female by birth or not.</p>
<p>We encourage you sure to make trans women feel welcome by saying so in your
meetup group and event descriptions. Here is an example of a statement you
could include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>PyLadies [city] is welcoming to and respectful of trans women. We
encourage all women to come out to our meetups.</div></blockquote>
<p>If the idea of trans people is new to you, you might want to take a look at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.thegenderbook.com">this fantastic illustrated book about gender</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.roostertailscomic.com/?p=1495">this comic</a>, or any of the
many other introductions to trans issues on the internet.</p>

<div class="section" id="is-your-goal-to-segregate-by-gender">
<h3>Is your goal to segregate by gender?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-your-goal-to-segregate-by-gender" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>No! PyLadies and local PyLadies chapters are about making the Python
community explicitly welcoming and accessible to women.</p>
<p>Women who wouldn’t otherwise attend a Python user group meeting often
attend local PyLadies chapter events, as a gateway to getting involved
with Python programming as a beginner, or getting more involved in the
Python community as an intermediate/advanced developer.</p>

<h3>What if my question isn’t answered here?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-if-my-question-isnt-answered-here" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ask in IRC #pyladies on <a class="reference external" href="http://irc.freenode.net">irc.freenode.net</a> if
you must. But feel free to organize your PyLadies chapter however you
wish, and make it completely your own. We’re here to help you, not to
limit you or control your plans.</p>
